# Sentinel Safety Contract (SSC)

This directory contains draft versions of the Sentinel Safety Contract (SSC), a minimal, evidence-scoped specification for actuator-boundary enforcement in embodied AI systems.

## Current Version

- [SSC v1.1 (Draft)](SSC_v1_1.md)

Status: TRL-4/5 draft for feedback  
Scope: Actuator-boundary invariants + conformance + evidence artifacts  
Not a certification framework

## Purpose

SSC standardizes:

- Actuator caps (velocity / acceleration / position / effort)
- Mode semantics (Teach / Field / Maintenance)
- Stop behavior
- Required machine-readable evidence fields

The goal is to make actuator-boundary safety claims reproducible and comparable across labs.

## Licensing

Software: Apache-2.0  
Hardware: CERN-OHL-P-2.0
