# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take safety-critical engineering seriously. If you discover a vulnerability—especially one that allows a **physical limit bypass** or a **containment breach**—please report it privately.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security bypasses.**

Please email your findings to **security@invariantgovernor.systems**.

## Research Policy
We specifically encourage "constructive safety" research. If you can demonstrate a method to:
1.  Bypass the rewrite/clamp logic (command injection).
2.  Crash the interposer into an unsafe/wedged state (DoS).
3.  Spoof the Independent Witness.

...we want to know. We commit to acknowledging receipt within 48 hours and coordinating a disclosure timeline (typically 90 days) to allow for remediation.
