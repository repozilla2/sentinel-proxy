> **“The AI can hallucinate all it wants. The physics will not comply.”**

Sentinel is an open-source **hardware safety interposer** (“physics firewall”) for embodied AI — plus an **executable Safety Contract (SSC)**, **conformance tests**, and **evidence packs** that make safety behavior **testable and reproducible**.

Sentinel sits between an **untrusted controller** (LLM agent, ROS 2 planner, custom stack) and the **actuator interface**, enforcing deterministic limits and producing machine‑readable proof artifacts.

## 🚀 Start Here (Evaluation-Oriented)

If you want to evaluate Sentinel quickly:

1. **Read the SSC v1.1 spec**  
   → `/docs/ssc/`  

2. **Review the Evidence Pack schema**  
   → `/evidence/schema.json`  

3. **Inspect a sample Evidence Pack**  
   → `/evidence/packs/EP-20260211-001.json`  

4. **See how to reproduce results**  
   → `/docs/EVALUATION.md`  

This repository is structured so that safety claims can be independently inspected and reproduced.

## What this repo is (and what it’s not)

### ✅ Sentinel is
- A **hardware interposer** between upstream compute and an actuator bus
- An **SSC (Safety Contract)**: units, semantics, modes, stop behavior, required evidence fields
- A **conformance + evidence workflow**: tests + logs + distributions you can reproduce

### ❌ Sentinel is not
- Not “AI alignment” — we constrain *physical authority*, not intent  
- Not “software guardrails” — enforcement is designed to run on independent hardware  
- Not “robot certification” — Sentinel is a safety layer + evidence engine that supports certification work

## Demo (TRL‑4): Safe-range clamp proof of concept

This repo’s current proof-of-concept demonstrates a simple, concrete safety guarantee:

- The actuator moves freely inside a configured safe range (example: **10° → 170°**)
- When an out-of-range position is requested, **Sentinel clamps** it to the configured safe limit
- The enforcement event is logged for review in the evidence pack

> *“Sentinel allows normal motion inside a safe range — and clamps any out‑of‑range command to the configured limit.”*

## Architecture

Sentinel proxies actuator commands, enforces SSC rules, and emits evidence artifacts.
